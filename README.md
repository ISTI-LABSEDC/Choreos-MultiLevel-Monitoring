# Choreos-MultiLevel-Monitoring

The deployment and the execution of applications
on dynamic Cloud infrastructures introduces new requirements
of adaptability with respect to monitoring. Specifically, the
governance of service choreographies enacted over Cloud-
based solutions relies on the observation and analysis of
events happening at different abstraction layers. Adaptability
requirements are even more evident when monitoring deals
with Service Level Agreements (SLA) established among the
choreography participants. In fact, as the Cloud paradigm
offers on-demand solutions as a service, often monitoring rules
cannot be completely defined off-line. Thus also the monitoring
infrastructure must keep track of the continuous evolution
of the underlying environment, and adapt itself accordingly.
This software demo proposes an adaptive multi-source monitoring
architecture that can synthesize on-the-fly SLA monitoring
rules following the evolution of the Cloud infrastructure.
